 *
 * Return: new node with product
 * Description:
 * Check if the doubly linked list has at least two nodes
 * Get the first two nodes of the doubly linked list
 * Calculat the product of the values of the first two nodes
 * Delet the first two nodes from the doubly linked list
 * Add a new node with the product as its value at the beginning
 * Handle the case of memory allocation failure
